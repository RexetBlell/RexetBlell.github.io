Add your hot wallet key (such as Metamask or Parity) with a delay of 2 months. Add your hardware wallet key (such as Ledger Nano S) with a delay of 2 weeks. Add your most secure key, such as a paper wallet and set the delay to 0. The idea is that the lower the security of the key, the higher the delay should be.</p>"

You would need to keep an eye on you wallet from time to time to make sure there are no unexpected pending transactions in it.</p>"
